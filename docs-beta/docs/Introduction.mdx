When your JavaScript repository has grown large enough that you have turned to using a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools) to help you organize your code as multiple packages inside a repository. That's great! However, you realized quickly that the build scripts defined inside the workspace have to be run in package dependency order.

There exists tools in the market that will provide a way for you to run these npm scripts in a topological order. These tools will allow you execute your tasks in the correct order. So why choose `lage` for your repository?

1. `lage` is battle tested - it is in use by many JavaScript repositories number in the millions lines of code each
2. `lage` can be easily adopted - all it takes is just one npm package install with a single configuration file for the entire repository
3. `lage` supports remote cache as a fallback - never build the same code twice
4. `lage` is optimized for modern multi-core development machines - don't waste your CPU resource waiting on a single core when you have so many to spare!

## How does `lage` figure out how to schedule tasks?

`lage` has a secret weapon: it has a "pipeline" configuration syntax to define the implicit relationship between tasks. Combined with a package graph, `lage` knows how to schedule which task to run first and which one can be run in parallel. Let's look at an example:

### A hypothetical example

1. Take a package graph

<ThemedImage
  alt="Package graph"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/package-graph.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/package-graph-dark.png"),
  }}
  style={{
    height: "400px"
  }}
/>

2. Combine it with a task graph:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Package graph"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/task-graph.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/task-graph-dark.png"),
  }}
  style={{
    height: "400px"
  }}
/>

3. `lage` generates a "target graph"

<ThemedImage
  alt="Package graph"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/target-graph.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/target-graph-dark.png"),
  }}
  style={{
    height: "400px"
  }}
/>
